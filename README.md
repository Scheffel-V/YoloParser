## Darknet docs

Inside this repo you can find `darknet_superfuturo` folder. There is a compiled, configured, gpu (CUDA) enabled darknet and its weights, as well as some training images we used.
There you will also find scripts that starts the parser for each view. For more information, check the [darknet_superfuturo doc](darknet_superfuturo/README.md).
